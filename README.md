# Customer analytics framework for online retail stores

In this project, we propose to build an application that will help online retail stores in offering personalized services to customers. To achieve better results, three strategies in customer analytics are considered in this project - a personalized recommendation system, categorization of customers, and sales trend analysis for achieving better customer retention.

## Features
 * #### Support for Excel and MySQL data input

      * Input transaction data can be loaded from either Excel or MySQL.

      * Formatting functions and filter functions can be specified to the particular input without affecting the other input.

 * #### Re-usable independent module for data pre-processing

      * Data pre-processing is made as an independent step. The pre-processed data can be retrieved without running the entire program and can be re-used by any other program.

      * Data pre-processing can be set specific to input from MySQL/Excel without affecting the processing from a different source.


 * #### RFM Analysis

      * re-usable model which performs Recency, Frequency, and monetary matrix based analysis on the transactional data.

      * All the 3 aspects of the analysis are modularized so single analysis can be performed without any code change.

 * #### Customer segmentation
